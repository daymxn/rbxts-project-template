# TODO

We're getting this ready for `create-rbxts-project`.

We're gonna follow a two step process:

1. modify everything so that it's general purpose
2. Implement tempalte files at the root (outside `/wiki`)

Non template behavior:

- Api folder when api enabled
- project-config.json

Left off:

- I applied for algolia for `@rbxts/expect`. I should be getting an email after I'm accepted.
- If I'm accepted soon, then I should add the relevant code to the template too.
- Beyond that, I _think_ I'm done here. Next steps would be implementing the templates.
